# Master-thesis

The files in this repository belongs to the paper 'Modelling the Effects of Wind Characteristics on Wind Gust Statistics in a GEV Distribution'. Various variable selection methods are compared in order to select the most informative wind covariates in a cGEV model. The used variable selection methods are the ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, the adaptive lasso and the adaptive elastic net. 

An explanation is given in each file about the working of the code.
